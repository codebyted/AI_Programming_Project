Project Title
SMART DATA ANALYZER

SHORT DESCRIPTION
This project is a Python-based AI Data Analyzer that allows users to:
- Load and analyze datasets (CSV or Excel)
- Clean and format data automatically
- Generate insights such as mean, median, skewness, and kurtosis
- Detect missing values and outliers
- Perform visual analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Run machine learning tasks like Linear Regression and K-Means Clustering
- Respond to natural language queries about the dataset

It combines AI, data science, and automation for smart data handling.


FEATURES
- Data quality checks (missing values, duplicates)
- Summary statistics with formatting
- Automated insights & visualizations
- Linear regression and clustering analysis
- AI question-answer feature about dataset
- Supports both CSV and Excel datasets

Python Libraries Used and purpose:

Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis |
Numpy- Numerical computation |
Matplotlib- Data visualization |
Seaborn - Advanced statistical plots |
Sklearn - Machine learning (Regression, Clustering) |
Termcolor - Colored text output in console |
Tkinter - File dialog for selecting datasets |

 How to Run the Code

Prerequisites
Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed, then install the required libraries:

\\bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn termcolor
